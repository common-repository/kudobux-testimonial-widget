The best way to convince normal visitors to your site to trust your brand and buy from your store or use your services is to show them positive reviews from past customers. Social Reviews is the best app to help you achieve this.

---> Connect any of the social channels mentioned above 
---> We’ll pull in all the reviews from the channels into a dashboard 
---> Choose the reviews you want to show on your site and want your visitors to see 
---> We display your chosen reviews in beautiful widgets on your site 
---> Your business grows

More features of the app

-- Collect new reviews

Apart from using already gotten reviews, we help you collect new reviews to add up to the list. Through our widgets which are shown on your site and through a dedicated subdomain we create for you, customers of your store can leave new reviews. These new reviews then get added to the list on your dashboard.

-- Beautiful widgets for almost all use cases

We have four widget styles to help display your reviews. There’s a widget to show reviews on any page a potential customer visits on your store. There’s another one that is only shown on specific pages (product pages) of your site. We have one that displays reviews in a carousel to be shown on any part of your site you see fit. There’s a widget for when you want a specific menu item dedicated for reviews. We also have our trust badge widget where we combine your reviews with our brand to boost your credibility.

And there are new more widgets coming soon.

-- SEO minisite

Part of having a successful online business is having good SEO for your store. We help you better your SEO performance with the SEO minisite feature. With this feature, you get a dedicated subdomain (with the ability to customize the subdomain using CNAME) that displays all your published reviews in a way that is easily indexable by search engines. When your reviews get indexed by Google, it’ll add a lot of SEO benefit to your site.

-- Automatic publishing and sharing

There are somethings you don’t want to repeatedly do. That’s why we have the Auto Publish feature to help you automatically start showing new positive reviews on your site. You don’t have to login every now and then to publish reviews, tell us which kind of reviews you want published and we’ll publish them as they come in.

In a similar way, we can automatically share great new reviews to your Facebook page to drive up engagement as they come in.

-- Offline reviews

You can have word of mouth reviews showing on your site. With the offline reviews feature, you get to add any review that comes in via offline sources so you’re not missing out on great oral testimonials.

-- Import reviews

If you've used other reviews tools in the past and want to bring reviews from those platforms into our dashboard, you can do so. Import reviews from Judgeme, Yotpo, Loox, Stamped.io
